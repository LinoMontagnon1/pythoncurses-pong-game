# PONG GAME

I made this Pong game to help me learn Python curses.

To play:
1. Download the game files as a zip archive.
2. Extract the contents to a directory of your choice.
3. Open CMD.
4. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
5. Run the Python script with the command: `python pong.py`.
6. Use 'W' and 'S' for player one.
7. Use the 'Up' arrow key and 'Down' arrow key for player two.
8. You can resize the CMD screen to your preferred size; the thinner it is, the easier it becomes.
